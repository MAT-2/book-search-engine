# Description

Module 21 - Building a search engine that searches for books.

It was a fun challenge trying to build an Apollo GraphQL server in the back-end in order to work with different mutations based on existing data that is added and saved and removed. However, I had some setbacks implementing mutation functions directly within client-side capabilities. Other than that, it was a fun and challenging work experience that enables me to think out of the box.
